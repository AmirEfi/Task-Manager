# Task-Manager
## Final Project of Introduction to Programming course - Fall 2020

This is my final project in the ITP course.

You can add your tasks with a title, a priority, and a deadline in it.

It shows tasks in order of the highest priority to you but it doesn't save it for the next run.

Hope you'd like it :)
